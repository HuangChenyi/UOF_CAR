                                can be performed according to different situations. Basically, the operations can
                                be divided into four types: Send to next stop, specify approval, unlock and void.

                        <p>
                            Send to next stop: When the approver click
                            ¡§abnormal send¡¨, the administrator then clicks ¡§send to next
                                    stop¡¨ to set up the approvingmember so that the form can
                                        continue to be sent to the next stop or to be closed. And the subsequent stop will
                                        become free flow. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Specify approval: When the approver does
                                not approve for a long time, or when the approver forgets to set up the agent, the
                                administrator can set up for the approver so as to speed up the processing speed
                                of the form. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unlock void: If it is 
                                ¡§multi-or approval¡¨ or ¡§multi-and approval¡¨ form, then when certain approver
                                        has seen the form but has not signed it yet, it will cause other approver be unable
                                        to approve, hence, the administrator can unlock void of the form so that other approver
                                        can approve on it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            void: Since there is trouble on the form, or
                                the form is filled wrong, hence, the form needs to be rejected, and the rejected
                                form can be deleted.
